## Introduction 

In the past, I've taken blogging seriously. I wrote a lot about large ideas or big concepts. I've been published by many websites. 

Along the way I found my interest in writing went downward, mostly because it felt like too much of a burden. I had to write for accomplishment, not for fun. To reduce the friction and to encourage myself to write more, I started this micro blog. It will be much smaller pieces of content. It will focused on things I'm learning and less so on the results of my work.

Cheers üçª
