title: Introduction

In the past, I've taken blogging seriously. I wrote a lot about large ideas or big concepts. I've been published by many websites. But along the way I lost my interest in writing because it felt like too much of a burden. To reduce the friction and to encourage myself to write more, I started this micro blog. It will be much smaller pieces of content. It will focused on things I'm learning and less so on the results of my work.
